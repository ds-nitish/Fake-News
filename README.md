# Fake News Classifier using Embedding Layer and LSTM

This repository contains a fake news classifier implemented using an Embedding layer and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. The classifier is trained on a dataset of news articles labeled as either fake or real. The model learns to distinguish between fake and real news based on the textual content of the articles.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of news articles labeled as fake or real. The dataset should be in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format with the following columns:

- **text**: The textual content of the news article.
- **label**: The label indicating whether the news article is fake or real. It can be either 0 (fake) or 1 (real).

Please ensure that the dataset file is placed in the `data` directory of this repository.

## Preprocessing

Before training the classifier, the dataset needs to be preprocessed. The preprocessing steps include:

1. Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
2. Removing stopwords: Removing common words that do not carry much meaning (e.g., "the", "is", "in").
3. Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").

The preprocessing is performed to convert the raw text into a format suitable for training the model.

## Model Architecture

The fake news classifier utilizes an Embedding layer and LSTM model. Here is a brief overview of the architecture:

1. Embedding Layer: The embedding layer maps each word in the input sequence to a high-dimensional vector representation. This layer captures the semantic meaning of the words.
2. LSTM Layer: The LSTM layer processes the embedded word vectors to learn the contextual dependencies between words. It can understand and remember the sequential information in the text.
3. Dense Layer: The dense layer is responsible for the final classification. It takes the output from the LSTM layer and produces a binary classification output (fake or real).

The model is trained using labeled data, and the weights of the model are adjusted during training to minimize the classification error.

## Training

During the training phase, the preprocessed dataset is divided into training and validation sets. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set. The training process involves iteratively updating the model's parameters to minimize the loss function.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set that was not seen during training. The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are calculated to assess the performance of the classifier. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is able to classify fake and real news articles.

## Inference

Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used for inference on new news articles. Given a new article, the model takes the text as input and predicts whether it is fake or real. This can help users identify potentially misleading or false information in news articles.

## Conclusion

The fake news classifier implemented in this repository aims to detect and classify news articles as fake or real using an Embedding layer and LSTM model. By utilizing sequential information and word embeddings, the model can capture the contextual meaning of the text and make accurate predictions. The repository provides a foundation for further research and development in the field of fake news detection.
